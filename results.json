    "title": "A hidden diversity of ceratopsian dinosaurs in Late Cretaceous Europe | Nature",
    "description": "Late Cretaceous Europe was an archipelago with a dinosaur fauna characterized by island effects such as low diversity, relictualism and insular dwarfism1. Its dinosaur communities include a unique mix of groups with typical Laurasian or Gondwanan affinities and distinctive endemics1. Chief among the latter are rhabdodontids, considered to be early-branching iguanodontians characterized by unusual dental and postcranial features and known from abundant but very incomplete fossil remains2,3. By contrast, unequivocal evidence of horned dinosaurs (ceratopsians) is puzzlingly absent4, despite their ubiquitous occurrence in contemporary ecosystems of Asia and North America. Ajkaceratops from the Late Cretaceous of Hungary was described as the first definite ceratopsian from Europe5, but this identification has been strongly disputed4. Here we describe new material of Ajkaceratops and conduct phylogenetic analyses that support its ceratopsian affinities. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that some ‘rhabdodontid’ taxa are not, in fact, iguanodontians but actually ceratopsians. This suggests a substantial but previously hidden diversity and evolutionary history of European horned dinosaurs, and co-occurrence of iguanodontians and ceratopsians indicates greater similarity than previously appreciated to other Laurasian ecosystems. Our results challenge conventional understanding of ornithischian dinosaur evolution and indicate the need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the Late Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaur assemblages of Europe. New results indicate that rhabdodontids and the previously described Ajkaceratops are actually distinctive European ceratopsians, a group&nbsp;better known from Asia and North America."

    "description": "In 2020, a global surge of activism linked to the Black Lives Matter movement prompted scientists to stage an academic ‘strike’, drawing attention to the ethical responsibility of addressing systemic racism. This catalysed debate in conservation, adding urgency to decades of scholarship on marginalization. In this Perspective, we review this literature and examine how exclusion in conservation persists across intersections of race, class, urban–rural divides, nationality and power dynamics from local to global levels. We highlight how marginalization and ‘othering’ disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) communities, especially in the Global South. Expansion of protected areas and the prioritization of individual animal lives over human well-being can intensify such inequities. We propose a framework for more inclusive conservation: recognizing and supporting human rights, ensuring local community agency, challenging entrenched norms in BIPOC engagement, and fostering educational opportunities led by and for BIPOC communities. Amid shifting global politics, including reduced US federal support for social and conservation issues, this framework provides guidance to counter racism and exclusion. By rethinking conservation practice, it seeks to build long-lasting, equitable and inclusive approaches that respect both people and nature. This Perspective proposes a new framework to support the inclusion of Black, Indigenous and people of colour in conservation initiatives."

These processes often demand exacting conditions, including cryogenic temperatures and handling of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents.2,3 Here, we report a Matteson-type homologation which integrates these three transformations into a one-pot electrochemical process. This proof-of-concept approach combines electroreductive defluorination with boronate rearrangement, eliminating the need for organolithium reagents, cryogenic conditions, or specialist setups. The available trifluoromethylarenes are employed as carbenoid precursors for the first time, expanding the scope of Matteson reaction. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including identification of key reaction intermediates, DFT calculations, and electrochemical analysis, confirm the involvement of boronate formation and rearrangement in this “e-Matteson” homologation."

    "description": "Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) maintain the specialized lipid compositions of organellar membranes1,2. In humans, many LTPs are implicated in diseases3, but for the majority, the cargo and auxiliary lipids facilitating transfer remain unknown. We have combined biochemical, lipidomic and computational methods to systematically characterize LTP-lipid complexes4 and measure how LTP gains of function affect cellular lipidomes. We identified bound lipids for approximately half of the hundred LTPs analyzed, confirming known ligands, while discovering new ones across most LTP families. Gains in LTP function affected the cellular abundance of both their known and newly identified lipid ligands, indicating comparable functional relevance of the two ligand sets. Using structural bioinformatics, we have characterized mechanisms contributing to lipid selectivity, identifying preferences based on head group or acyl chain. We demonstrate some basic principles of how LTPs mobilise their ligands. They commonly interact with several classes of lipids and exhibit broad but selective preference, not only for particular head groups, but also for lipid species with shorter acyl chains containing one or two unsaturations, suggesting that only subsets of lipid species are efficiently mobilized. The datasets represent a resource for further analysis in different cell types and states, such as those associated with pathologies."

    "description": "The Galaxy’s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits1. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii)2,3. The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5–4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance. A nine-year transit-timing campaign has measured the extremely low masses and densities of four large planets orbiting the young star V1298 Tau, which are now predicted to contract and form a typical compact super-Earth and sub-Neptune system."

    "description": "The brain’s connectome1–3 and the vascular system4 are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout and, ultimately, their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organization. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of wiring minimization. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimization problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimization onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory5–7, predicting that, with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimization. Specifically, surface minimization predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organization of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which are not only prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi. Analysis of the local branching geometries of several physical networks shows violations of predictions of length and volume minimization, leading to the hypothesis that estimating the material cost requires accounting for the full three-dimensional geometry."
